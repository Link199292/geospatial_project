# Geospatial Analysis and Representation for Data Science (project)

This repository contains the project for Geospatial Analysis, which focuses on analyzing accidents in the city of Treviso. The structure of the repo is as follows:

- `Geospatial_Project.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis
- `Geospatial_Project1.5.ipynb`: Street Network Analysis and Clustering
- `Geospatial_Project_p2.ipynb`: Moran's Index
- `Pre-processing_prediction`: Data pre-processing and data splitting
- `Variables_analysis_and_prediction.html`: Analyses and predictions in an HTML format, converted from an R MarkDown file
- `R_data`: Folder containing the data required to reproduce the previous file.

Please note that the original dataset is not available for sharing. However, the `R_data` fodler contains the whole dataset aggregated in hexagons at a resolution of 8.

For a better experiene, the most significant explorations and analyses can be found [here](https://geospatialprojectludovicomariavalenti.netlify.app/). Please note that there is currently no back/home button on the pages: I am working on it.
